### Review from people

1. Toughest Interview includes basic to advance concepts with real time examples, "Tricky" Questions: These often involve edge cases, subtle differences between similar concepts (== vs. .equals(), String vs. StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer), or questions designed to probe your analytical thinking rather than just recall. Examples include questions about immutable objects, static methods, or custom classloaders.
